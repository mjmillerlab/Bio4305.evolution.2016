I will communicate with you via email (see below), and all assignments are due via Dropbox (see below).\r\n\r\n## What is evolution, and why study evolution?\r\nEvolution is the phenomenon of inherited change in biological organisms over time. Scientists repeatedly and ubiquitously observe organismal change overtime, and more recently have linked this change to the principle molecular driver of inheritance  (the genetic code). Thus the field of evolutionary biology seeks to understand what are the processes that drive inherited change, which include studying both how the observable organism (i.e. the phenotype), as well as the genotype, changes over successive generations.\r\n\r\nEvolution touches on some of the most fundamental questions of our being. And therefore, in mainstream society, the field of evolutionary biology is among the most controversial, misrepresented, and polemical sub-discipline in biology. Most biologists consider mastery of basic evolution as indispensable for any higher-level understanding in biology, and [Dobzhansky’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodosius_Dobzhansky) famous quote: “nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution,” is more true now in the age of genomes than perhaps Dobzhansky could have imagined in 1973.  \r\n\r\nI realize that very few of you will become professional evolutionary biologists, but whether you become a medical professional, a biomedical researcher, a teacher, a forensic detective, or a zookeeper, I hope that when you think about biology, you will think like an evolutionary biologist.  (borrowed from [J. McDonald, U. Delaware](http://udel.edu/~mcdonald/)).\r\n\r\n## Course Outline\r\nThe course is comprised of three-days-per-week lecture section and once-per-week laboratory section. Lectures are divided into three roughly equal sections. The first addresses macroevolutionary patterns in the history of life. The second section addresses the genetic basis of evolutionary change and adaptive evolution. The third section addresses sexual selection, parental and genome conflicts, human evolution, and evolutionary medicine.  \r\n\r\n## My Expectations\r\nIf you read the assignments **BEFORE** class, engage during lecture and lab discussion sessions (that means talking), complete the writing assignments and most importantly: **DEMONSTRATE** that you have thought critically about the material that you are presented, you will probably find that this course is relatively easy. I am working very hard to develop and adapt a course that teaches the fundamentals of evolutionary biology in a manner that is most relevant to you. On the other hand, if you don’t do the readings, disengage during discussions and lectures, and cram just before exams, you may consider this course to be extremely brutal.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, a substantial portion of your grade will come from in-lecture reading quizzes, which will occur at the beginning of most morning lectures. The questions won’t be hard, and there won’t be gotcha questions; the point is two-fold: the quizzes will establish your attendance, and they keep us all honest about the reading. Above, I stressed that my job is to take the fundamental material and make it as relevant as possible. By establishing before lecture that we’ve all read and grasped at least most of the basics, I can focus my time in lecture on detailed review of the any topics that are conceptually tricky and embellish the fundamentals with the most engaging and relevant real-world examples. There is NO make-up for missed reading quizzes. If you have an excused absence for a given reading quiz, your reading quiz grade is the average of all other quizzes.\r\n\r\n## Course Textbook\r\n***Zimmer, C., & D.J. Emlen. Evolution: Making Sense of Life. 2nd Edition. Roberts & Company, 2015***\r\n[Amazon link](http://www.amazon.com/Evolution-Making-Sense-Carl-Zimmer/dp/1936221551_)  \r\n\r\nAbout the text book....it’s awesome. And it’s a real quantum improvement in how evolutionary biology is presented to undergraduates. It’s written by [Carl Zimmer](http://carlzimmer.com/), a New York Times science writer, and [Doug Emlen](http://hs.umt.edu/dbs/labs/emlen/), who’s a great active evolutionary biologist. I think that you’ll find that Zimmer’s experience framing biology to the educated public — he’s one of the best science writers on the planet — makes the material much more accessible and engaging.  \r\n  \r\nThe textbook is really heavy. Please don’t bring the book to class, you might throw out your back. Read it at home **BEFORE** class. From a pedagogical standpoint, I recommend buying rather than renting the book, so that you can liberally mark the margins. It’s been shown repeatedly that such annotations improve learning. I’m not sure if we know how that extends to digital annotations.  \r\n\r\n***Recommended: Pechenik, J.A. A Short Guide to Writing About Biology. Pearson Longmans, 2012–2016.  (7th, 8th, or 9th editions acceptable)***\r\n[Amazon link](http://www.amazon.com/Short-Guide-Writing-about-Biology/dp/0321984250/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)\r\n\r\nYou are responsible for mastering the material in the writing guide. However, how you access it is up to you. Amazon has this book listed at about 55 dollars. That is too much; 20-30 dollars is appropriate, and you might find very good deals on earlier versions of this book. If you intend to write a thesis in Biology, or go on to graduate school, you might as well buy the a copy now (you will wear the pages thin). If not, perhaps you will consider buying a copy with a friend.  Students expecting to get a high grade in Evolution need to follow the writing canon that Pechenik articulates in his book.  \r\n\r\n## Exams\r\nAfter each course section there will be an exam worth 12.5% of your total grade. The final exam is worth 175 points, or 17.5% of your final grade. Two-thirds of the content of the final exam will be from the third course section, while 1/3 will be a review of the entire course.\r\n\r\n## Laboratory Discussion\r\nEach week in lab you will engage with primary scientific literature. I expect that you will have read carefully the article several times, and that you have gone beyond the article to understand the methods, results, figures, and take-home message of the paper.  To help you be accountable for the reading, there will be a lab reading quiz each lab session for which there is a primary reading. We will discuss the paper in a modified journal club style, which means that our class will be divided into two smaller sections, and you should expect to be called and discuss any aspect of the paper during the discussion. This can include going to the board and explaining what is going on in a figure. \r\n\r\nReading primary literature is quite different than reading the textbook, and requires a much different level of engagement. Even experienced senior academic scientists need to read most primary literature papers several times, and have to look up terms and techniques. Do not plan on lightly skimming the paper and hoping that lab discussion goes well….it won’t.\r\n\r\n##Viewpoint Assignment\r\nThe Biology department has identified Evolution as a both a writing-enriched and a Research Requirement course. The goal of the Research requirement is to engage students in the critical skills associated with academic research. Therefore, each student will be assigned a topic that is contemporarily relevant in evolutionary biology. The idea is to take themes (list available [here](http://mjmillerlab.github.io/Bio4305.evolution.2016/topics.html)) that are relevant to society at large, but that touch on evolution. Imagine a sophisticated cocktail party. However, you will engage the topic as a formal academic researcher, and you will review and synthesize the state of our knowledge on the topics. You will present this synthesis in the form of a standard term paper (which practicing scientists call review papers) In this class, the review paper will be short format, and focused around 1–3 recent scientific article(s). Thus it is best defined as a [viewpoint article](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/s/other-article-types#loc-viewpoints). \r\n\r\nAs is required of a writing enhanced paper, you will write a suitable first draft, which will be peer-reviewed by a classmate. You will revise your paper, and submit it to me for revision. Finally, I will give you feedback on how to improve the paper for a final draft. You will also present your synthesis to the class during lecture as a 12 minute presentation. Again, this is a standard format at professional conferences, with 3 minutes for questions from the class.\r\n\r\nYou will follow the [PLOS style guidelines](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines). However, as a [viewpoint](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/s/other-article-types#loc-viewpoints), you are limited to 1500 words and 15 citations. Your topic paper will be formatted as a [pre-submission inquiry](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/s/presubmission-inquiries). Specifically, they will outline the focus of the viewpoint in 500 words accompanied by a referenced abstract (not included in word count).\r\n\r\n[Here is an example of a viewpoint that I published in 2015](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0003383). And [here is the pre-submission inquiry](https://github.com/mjmillerlab/Bio4305.evolution.2016/files/78786/MillerPreSub.PDF). Obviously, you won't have methodology or key results. But you should have background and conclusions. \r\n\r\nYou will also present your viewpoint to the class as an oral presentation (with slideshow). You will need to submit your presentation file (as Powerpoint, Keynote, Prezi, or PDF) via Dropbox by 2 PM on the day of your presentation. Presentations will follow standard scientific format in that they are 12 minutes with 3 minutes allowed for questions. Students will be graded both on their presentation as well as the quality of their questions during other students' presentations.\r\n\r\n## Grading\r\nGrading standards follows the [guidelines](http://www1.villanova.edu/villanova/vpaa/studentservices/policies/grades.html) established by Villanova University.\r\n\r\nAs such, grade distributions will follow this scale based on 1000 total as follows:\r\n\r\n| Deliverable  | Points |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| Lecture Reading Quizzes  | 75  |\r\n| Mid-term Exam 1  | 130  |\r\n| Mid-term Exam 2  | 130  |\r\n| Final Exam  | 190  |\r\n| Lab Discussion Reading Quizzes  | 60  |\r\n| Neandertal–Modern Human Writing Assignment | 20\r\n| Viewpoint Topic Paper  | 25  |\r\n| Viewpoint Peer Review  | 20  |\r\n| First Draft Viewpoint  | 75  |\r\n| Final Draft Viewpoint  | 125  |\r\n| Viewpoint Oral Presentation | 50 |\r\n| Lab Discussion Participation | 50 |\r\n| Lecture Participation | 50 |\r\n\r\nThe actual grading scale will be determined at the end of the semester, but I am inclined not to curve the course at all. I.e. 935 points = 93.5% for the course score. Let’s all work together to make this a reality! Quiz and exam grades will be posted within one week to Blackboard.\r\n\r\nImportantly, your final grade cannot be higher than the percentile score for the average of your lecture and lab discussion reading quizzes. For example, if you score an A– overall in the course, yet only manage to score the equivalent of a B on reading quizzes your grade would be a B, rather than A–.  Most students that do the readings consistently and attend class will find that the quizzes raise, rather than lower, their overall grade in the course.\r\n\r\n## Attendance\r\nPlease see the official [Villanova attendance policy](http://www1.villanova.edu/villanova/vpaa/studentservices/policies/attendance.html).\r\n\r\nIf you know that you will have to miss lecture or lab because of an excused event or a serious illness, please contact me as soon as possible. The first three excused reading quizzes will be ignored, and your grade will be determined based on the remaining quizzes. Once you have accumulated 3 missed lecture or 2 missed lab quizzes, you must see me during office hours to determine the appropriate make up assignment. Unexcused reading quizzes earn a 0; the same for unexcused, missed, midterm exams.\r\n\r\nLaboratory work in Evolution is largely cumulative, and there is no opportunity to schedule make up work. Our lab section occurs during non-traditional hours (Wednesdays from 3–6 pm), and if you can already anticipate that you will have an excused conflict (perhaps an athletic event or other university business) that will require that you miss 3 or more lab sections, please contact Dr. Miller immediately. We will need to work out a solution with the Biology Department. Any unexcused laboratory absence will result in 100 points being deducted from a student’s total accumulated points at the end of the semester. \r\n\r\n## Academic Accommodations\r\nIt is the policy of Villanova to make reasonable academic accommodations for qualified individuals with learning disabilities. If you are a person with a disability and wish to request accommodations to complete your course requirements, please make an appointment with me as soon as possible to discuss the request.  If you would like information on documentation requirements, contact the Office of Learning Support Services at 610-519-5636, visit the office on the 2nd floor of Kennedy Hall, or visit [their webpage](http://www.learningsupportservices.villanova.edu).\r\n\r\nThe Office of Disability Services collaborates with students, faculty, staff, and community members to create diverse learning environments that are usable, equitable, inclusive and sustainable. The ODS provides Villanova University students with physical disabilities the necessary support to successfully complete their education and participate in activities available to all students. If you have a diagnosed disability and plan to utilize academic accommodations, please contact Gregory Hannah, advisor to students with disabilities at 610-519-3209 or visit the office on the second floor of the Connelly Center. *If you require an academic accommodation, please discuss this with me at the beginning of the semester*. \r\n\r\n## Academic Integrity\r\nStudents are expected to know and comply with all University policies related to academic dishonesty and plagiarism. Please read the [Villanova University Code of Academic Integrity](http://www.vpaa.villanova.edu/academicintegrity). I have a zero tolerance policy on academic dishonesty, and will use all tools available to me at Villanova to ensure the academic integrity of this course.\r\n\r\n## Course Communication\r\nI often send out announcements and reminders via Villanova email  – you are required to check your Villanova email and Blackboard on a regular basis for these items. I will not send emails to any non-VU address, so if you use another email server, you are responsible for setting up your VU email so that it forwards all email to your other account.  You should email me at my Villanova email listed above. If it is a weekday, I should be able to respond to you that day. On weekends, I may not respond until Monday.  \r\n\r\nCourse materials will be available on this website. All students must maintain a Dropbox folder for the course. I will invite you to the folder which you will share with me and the TA. You will turn all assignments in via Dropbox (not email); likewise, assignments will be returned to you via Dropbox.\r\n\r\n##Lecture Schedule\r\n| Date | Topic | Reading |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| **Week 1**\t|   |   |\r\n|Jan 11 |\tIntroduction to the course\t|   |\r\n| Jan 13 |\tEvolution in Influenza\t| Z&E 1.2—1.3 |\r\n|Jan 15 |\tDarwinian Revolution |\tZ&E 2 |\r\n| **Week 2**\t|   |   |\r\n|Jan 18 |\tMartin Luther King Day\t| No Class  |\r\n| Jan 20 |\tWhat the Rocks Say\t| Z&E 3.1—3.6 |\r\n|Jan 22 |\tFossils: History of Life |\tZ&E 3.7—3.11 |\r\n| **Week 3**\t|   |   |\r\n|Jan 25 |\tPhylogeny: The Tree of Life\t| Z&E 4.1—4.3  |\r\n| Jan 27 | Rise of the Tetrapods\t| Z&E 4.4—4.7 |\r\n|Jan 29|\tGuest Lecture: Dr. Jose Loaiza, INDICASAT-AIP, Panama | Evolutionary Dynamics of Tropical Disease Vectors  |\r\n| **Week 4**\t|   |   |\r\n|Feb 01 |\tMolecular Evolution Basics |\tZ&E 5.1—5.2 |\r\n|Feb 03 | Heredity |\tZ&E 5.3—5.5 |\r\n|Feb 05 | Reproductive Isolation | Z&E 13.1—13.2 |\r\n| **Week 5**\t|   |   |\r\n| Feb 08 | Geography of Speciation | Z&E 13.3—13.4 |\r\n| Feb 10 | The Speed of Speciation | Z&E 13.5—13.7 |\r\n| Feb 12 | Macroevolution I | Z&E  14.1—14.3 |\r\n| **Week 6**\t|   |   |\r\n| Feb 15 | Macroevolution II | Z&E 14.4—14.6;  |\r\n| Feb 17 | Pop.
